description="Based in Linz ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹, I work at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.dynatrace.com/'>Dynatrace</a>, an application performance monitoring company. Our vision is to build a world where anyone can create a thriving business through accessible tools and technology. <br/>A specialized generalist at heart, I bring a unique blend of expertise across backend systems, mobile development, and infrastructure. Over my career, I've led teams of all sizesâ€”from hands-on coding to scaling engineering groupsâ€”always anchored in the 3P framework: <strong>People, Product, Process</strong>.<br/>I'm driven by cultivating high-performing teams that embrace iterative improvement, psychological safety, and purpose-driven work. Whether refining agile workflows or mentoring future leaders, my goal is to build environments where both products <em>and</em> people thrive."

{{< about-section
title="Who am I?"
content="<p class='lead'>An engineer at heart and a problem-solver by nature, I channel curiosity and energy into creating technology that simplifies lives. Leadership, for me, means rolling up my sleeves: you'll find me debugging code with engineers one hour and aligning product strategy the next. I'm a <strong>deliberate generalist</strong>, a T-shaped professional with a hybrid toolkit: part technical architect, part team builder. After founding a startup, I learned to bridge business vision and technical executionâ€”scaling systems, mentoring teams, and advocating for user-centric design. My leadership thrives on three principles: <ol><li><strong>Iterative Improvement:</strong> I foster teams that treat progress as a cycle of experimentation, feedback, and refinement.</li><li><strong>Radical Transparency:</strong> From blocks to wins, I believe open communication builds trust and aligns goals.</li><li><strong>Empathy as a Superpower:</strong> Understanding diverse perspectivesâ€”whether engineers, clients, or end-usersâ€”fuels better decisions and stronger collaboration.</li></ol><br/><strong>My superpower?</strong> Versatility. From architecting backend systems (Node.js, Java or PHP) or mobile apps, to optimizing CI/CD pipelines, I connect dots across disciplines to build products that resonate. But technology alone isn't the answer: I obsess over <em>how</em> teams work, fostering environments where psychological safety and iterative learning drive innovation."
